In this situation, the firewall solution will need to be provided before an unsyndicated login attempt can be attempted - effectively meaning that any known password cracking software will be useless while a firewall is active.

Firewall complexity can be examined with the "analyze" command - running the analyze command multiple times will automatically detect patterns in the response data headers and will eliminate characters it can guarantee are not a part of the correct firewall solution.
