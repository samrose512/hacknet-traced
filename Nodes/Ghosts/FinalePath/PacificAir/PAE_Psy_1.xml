  Has File downloaded form the Internet describing how to speed up torrents (opening torrent port),
  contains some sort of example with port numbers, and they've changed the port to match it exactly
  
  This needs to contain the username and password used for the IRC server on it (but not an IP link to the server itself).
  Perhaps write a file about it always being open, so they never have to reconnect to it or something?

PortSmacker is a tool intended for speeding up your torrents by using nontraditional ports to punch through ISP-level NAT throttling and firewalls.

The user interface mimics a spreadsheet; to change a setting, just type a number in a cell and hit Enter. This tool is intended for advanced users, so don't fuck it up.

Example Usage:

I want to speed up my torrents, but port 6881 is throttled by my ISP. To get around that, I drop down to port 8, which, for some reason, works much better. Eventually the ISP will get wise, and start throttling port 8, but until then, it's fine to keep using it.
